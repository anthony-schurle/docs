**Christianity as Practiced in Contemporary Western Society: A Privileged Religion**

Contemporary Western Christianity—the dominant institutional form practiced across North America and Europe—operates as a privileged religion due to assumptions about resources, cultural framing, and moral uniformity. This critique focuses specifically on mainstream Protestant and Catholic practice as socially embedded in affluent Western contexts, though similar dynamics may apply to other institutionalized religions in positions of cultural dominance.

This is not an indictment of Christianity as such, nor of its diverse historical expressions. Early Christianity was largely a movement of the marginalized, practiced in house churches by communities sharing resources. Liberation theology, Black church traditions, Christian anarchism, and monastic simplicity movements all resist the patterns described here. Rather, this analysis targets the hegemonic form that emerged through Christianity's entanglement with Western capitalism, colonialism, and cultural imperialism—a historically contingent development, not an inevitable feature of the faith.

**The Material Privilege of "Proper Practice"**

In contemporary Western Christianity, access to full participation is non-uniform across socioeconomic lines, yet full participation is often treated as fundamental to authentic faith. Failing to attend weekly services, participate in study groups, or give tithes is frequently judged as a sign of spiritual deficiency rather than recognized as a structural barrier.

Consider a typical Sunday service in a mainstream Western church: soothing incense, candles, rows of seating with Bibles, decorative crosses, altar cloths, refreshments for fellowship. These material goods—from the coffee served in the parish hall to the mass-produced devotional items sold in church bookstores—often depend on the exploitation of underpaid workers abroad. The church building itself, the technology for streaming services, the climate control, the parking lot—all encode assumptions about transportation, schedule flexibility, and disposable time that exclude large portions of humanity.

Yet the framework of "faithful practice" treats these conditions as neutral, universal, and essential. The mere act of weekly attendance assumes car ownership or reliable public transit, Sunday availability (excluding service workers), childcare access, appropriate clothing, and often the social capital to navigate middle-class congregational norms. Those unable to meet these conditions are frequently positioned as spiritually deficient rather than systematically excluded.

**Cultural Imperialism and the White Jesus**

Perhaps nowhere is Western Christianity's cultural privilege more visible than in its visual culture. Western portrayals routinely depict Jesus, Mary, and other biblical figures as white Europeans, erasing the religion's actual origins in the Middle East and North Africa. This is not mere artistic license—it reflects and reinforces a colonial framework in which Western culture is imposed onto the very societies where Christianity originated.

This dynamic extends to contemporary missionary work. Even well-intentioned "missions" often export Western cultural assumptions—about family structure, gender roles, economic organization, worship styles—under the guise of spreading universal faith. Indigenous or non-Western expressions of Christianity are frequently treated as incomplete or immature, requiring Western oversight and correction. The entire apparatus treats Western Christianity as the authentic form and other expressions as deviations, inverting the historical and geographical reality.

**The Selective Deployment of "Personal Interpretation"**

A peculiar feature of Western Christian discourse is its selective invocation of interpretive freedom. When defending Christianity against charges of rigidity or uniformity, Western practitioners frequently emphasize that the Bible "depends on personal interpretation"—that faith is a personal relationship with God, that each believer must discern truth for themselves, that no single reading is authoritative.

Yet this hermeneutical pluralism vanishes precisely when interpretation challenges Western norms or power structures. When Christians in the Global South develop liberation theology emphasizing radical wealth redistribution, they're accused of politicizing faith. When queer Christians interpret scripture as affirming rather than condemning, they're told they're twisting the text to suit their desires. When indigenous communities syncretize Christian practice with traditional spirituality, they're seen as practicing an impure or confused version of the faith.

The pattern is consistent: "personal interpretation" is celebrated when it allows Western Christians to selectively ignore inconvenient passages (prohibitions on usury, commands to sell possessions and give to the poor, warnings about the impossibility of the wealthy entering heaven). But interpretation becomes suspect, even heretical, when it challenges white supremacy, capitalism, heteronormativity, or Western cultural dominance.

This selective hermeneutics extends to reason itself. Western Christians routinely employ sophisticated textual analysis, historical criticism, and philosophical argumentation to defend their faith against secular critique. Biblical scholarship, apologetics, and theology are presented as rigorous intellectual disciplines. Yet when those same tools are used to question power structures _within_ Christianity—the male-only priesthood, the prosperity gospel, the blessing of colonial ventures—suddenly such analysis is dismissed as worldly thinking that misses the spiritual point.

The result is an epistemological double standard: reason and personal interpretation are valuable tools when defending Western Christianity from external critique, but become threats when applied to internal contradictions or marshaled by marginalized communities seeking to reshape practice. Authority and tradition are invoked to shut down certain interpretations while individual conscience is celebrated for others. The determining factor isn't theological coherence but whether the interpretation preserves or challenges existing hierarchies.

**The Paradox of Reason**

Most peculiar is the epistemological bind at the heart of much Western Christian practice. According to Genesis, humanity gained the capacity to reason through the "fruit of knowledge"—reason itself is understood as God-given, central to human dignity and moral capacity. Yet many mainstream Christian frameworks simultaneously suggest that human reason should not question God, scripture, or church authority.

To prohibit questioning is to prohibit reasoning. Reason operates by examining premises, testing claims, following evidence, and remaining open to revision. A framework that grants reason divine origin while constraining its exercise creates a fundamental contradiction—and this constraint operates most powerfully precisely where material and structural disparities are most evident. Questions about wealth disparity in congregations, the ethics of supply chains, the exclusion of the poor, or the cultural imperialism of missions are often met with calls for faith over analysis, trust over critique.

**Conclusion: Privilege Recognized**

Contemporary Western Christianity, as institutionally practiced, is privileged: materially, culturally, and epistemically. Its definition of faithful practice encodes class assumptions. Its cultural expressions reflect colonial power. Its epistemological frameworks selectively constrain the very reasoning capacity it claims as divinely granted.

This is not a claim about all Christianity everywhere, nor about Christian theology in the abstract. It is a historically specific critique of the dominant form that emerged through Western modernity. Recognition of these disparities is both intellectually honest and theologically necessary—an exercise of the God-given reason that should not be constrained when confronting contradictions and inequalities embedded in the practice of faith.

Other institutionalized religions in positions of cultural dominance may exhibit similar patterns, though Christianity remains the case I know best and the one with the most extensive global reach through Western power structures.
