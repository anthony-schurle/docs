## 0.0 Topological Spaces
---
### Definitions
- **Topology**
  - A topology on a set X is a collection $\Gamma$ of subsets of X having the following properties:
  - (1) $\emptyset, X \in \Gamma$.
  - (2) $\forall A (A \subseteq \Gamma \implies \bigcup_{a \in A} a \in \Gamma)$.
  - (3) $\forall A(A \subseteq \Gamma \land |A| < \infty \implies \bigcap_{a \in A} a \in \Gamma)$.
- **Topological Space**
  - Set X for which a topology $\Gamma$ has been specified.
  - Represented as an ordered pair $(X, \Gamma)$.
- **Open Set**
  - For $(X, \Gamma)$, we have $U \subseteq X$ and $U \in \Gamma$.
- **Discrete Topology**
  - $\Gamma = \mathcal{P}(X)$.
- **Trivial Topology**
  - $\Gamma = X, \emptyset$.
- **Multiple Topology**
  - Suppose $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ are two topologies on the set X.
  - If $\Gamma \subseteq \Gamma'$, then $\Gamma '$ is finer than $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma$ is coarser than $\Gamma '$.
  - If $\Gamma \subset \Gamma'$, then $\Gamma '$ is strictly finer than $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma$ is strictly coarser than $\Gamma '$.
  - If $\Gamma$ is comparable with $\Gamma '$ if either $\Gamma' \subseteq \Gamma$ or $\Gamma \subseteq \Gamma '$.

### Theorems & Proofs
**Finite Complement Topology**
Let $\Gamma$ be the collection of all subsets U of X such that $X - U$ is either finite or all of X. It is easy to see that $X, \emptyset \in \Gamma$. Define arbitrary family of nonempty elements $\{U_\alpha\} \subseteq \Gamma$. Notice,
$$
X \backslash \bigcup U_{\alpha} = \bigcap (X \backslash U_{\alpha})
$$
with the latter set being finite because each set $X \backslash U_{\alpha}$ is finite. Define arbitrary finite family of non-empty elements $\{U_\alpha\} \subseteq \Gamma$. Notice,
$$
X \backslash \bigcap U_\alpha = \bigcup (X \backslash U_\alpha)
$$
The latter set is a finite union of finite sets and, therefore, finite.

## 0.1 Basis For A Topology
---
### Definitions
- **Basis**
  - A basis for $(X, \Gamma)$ is a collection $\beta$ of subsets of X such that:
  - (1) $\forall x \in X \exists B \in \beta (x \in B)$.
  - (2) $\forall x \in X \forall B_1, B_2 \in \beta (x \in B_1 \cap B_2 \implies \exists B_3 \in \beta (x \in B_3 \land B_3 \subseteq B_1 \cap B_2))$.
  - To generate a topology, $\Gamma := \{U \subseteq X : \forall x \in U\exists B \in \beta (x \in B \land B \subseteq U)\}$.
- **Standard Topology**
  - Topology generated by the collection of all open intervals on $\mathbb{R}$.
  - $(a, b) = \{x : a < x < b\}$.
- **Lower Limit Topology**
  - Topology ($\mathbb{R}_l$) generated by the collection of all half-open intervals.
  - $[a, b) = \{x : a \leq x < b\}$.
- **k-Topology**
  - Topology ($\mathbb{R}_K$) generated by the collection of all open intervals along with all sets of the form (a, b) - K where K is the set of all numbers of the form $\frac{1}{n}$ for $n \in Z_+$.
- **SubBasis**
  - A subbasis S for a topology on X is a collection of subsets of X whose union equals X (axiom 1 of basis).
  - The topology generated is the collection of all unions of finite intersections of S.

### Theorems & Proofs
**Generated Topology**
The empty set satisfies the condition of openness vacuously. Likewise, $X \in \Gamma$, since for each $x \in X$, there is a basis element containing x and contained in X. Define arbitrary $\{U_a\}_{a\in J} \subseteq \Gamma$ and let $U = \bigcup_{a \in J}U_a$. Given $x \in U$, there is an index $\alpha$ such that $x \in U_\alpha$. But $U_\alpha$ is open, so there is some basis element B where $x \in B \subseteq U_\alpha$. It follows that $x \in B \land B \subseteq U$ and so by definition, $U \in \Gamma$. Now take two elements $U_1, U_2$ of $\Gamma$. Given $x \in U_1 \cap U_2$, choose a basis element $B_1$ containing x such that $B_1 \subseteq U_1$; choose also a basis element $B_2$ containing x such that $B_2 \subseteq U_2$. Then the second condition of a basis allows us to choose $B_3$ containing x such that $B_3 \subseteq B_1 \cap B_2$. Then $x \in B_3$ and $B_3 \subseteq U_1 \cap U_2$ so $U_1 \cap U_2 \in \Gamma$. Finally, we show by induction that any finite intersection $U_1 \cap ... \cap U_n$ of elements of $\Gamma$ is in $\Gamma$. This is trivial for $n = 1$. Suppose it is true for $n - 1$. We have $(U_1 \cap ... \cap U_n) = (U_1 \cap ... \cap U_{n - 1}) \cap U_n$. By hypothesis, $U_1 \cap ... \cap U_{n - 1} \in \Gamma$. But we showed $U_1 \cap U_2 \in \Gamma$ for arbitrary $U_1$ and $U_2$ so $(U_1 \cap ... \cap U_{n - 1}) \cap U_n \in \Gamma$. Thus, $\Gamma$ is a topology. 

**Lemma 13.1**
Let X be a set; let $\beta$ be a basis for $(X, \Gamma)$. Then $\Gamma$ is the collection of all unions of elements of $\beta$.

Given a collection of elements of $\beta$, they are also elements of $\Gamma$. Because $\Gamma$ is a topology, their union is in $\Gamma$. Conversely, given $U \in \Gamma$. Choose for each $x \in U$ an element $B_x \in \beta$ such that $x \in B_x \subseteq U$. Then $U = \bigcup_{x \in U}B_x$, so U equals a union of elements of $\beta$.

**Lemma 13.2**
Let X be a topological space. Suppose that C is a collection of open sets of X such that for each open set U of X and each x in U, there is an element c of C such that $x \in c \subseteq U$. Then C is a basis for the topology of X.

Given $x \in X$, since X itself is an open set, there is by hypothesis an element $c \in C$ such that $x \in c \subseteq X$. Let $x \in c_1 \cap c_2$ for $c_1, c_2 \in C$. Since $c_1$ and $c_2$ are open, so is $c_1 \cap c_2$. Therefore, there exists by hypothesis an element $c_3$ in C such that $x \in c_3 \subseteq c_1 \cap c_2$. Thus, C is a basis.
Let $\Gamma$ be the collection of open sets of X. Define $\Gamma'$ as the topology generated by C. Suppose $U \in \Gamma$. If $x \in U$, then there is a $c \in C$ such that $x \in c \subseteq U$. By definition, $U \in \Gamma'$. Conversely, suppose $W \in \Gamma '$. Then W is a union of elements of C by the preceding lemma. Since each element of C belongs to $\Gamma$, W also belongs to $\Gamma$.

**Lemma 13.3**
Let $B$ and $B'$ be bases for the topologies $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ on X. The following are equivalent:
(1) $\Gamma'$ is finer than $\Gamma$.
(2) $\forall x \in X \forall b \in B (x \in b \implies \exists b' \in B' (x \in b' \subseteq b))$.

($(2) \implies (1)$) Given $U \in \Gamma$, we wish to show $U \in \Gamma'$. Let $x \in U$. Since $B$ generates $\Gamma$, there is an element $b \in B$ such that $x \in b \subseteq U$. Condition (2) tell us that there is some $b' \in B'$ such that $x \in b' \subseteq b$. Then $x \in b' \subseteq U$, so $U \in \Gamma'$ be definition.
($(1) \implies (2)$) We are given $x \in X$ and $b \in B$, with $x \in b$. b belongs to $\Gamma$ by definition and $\Gamma \subseteq \Gamma'$ by condition (1); therefore $b \in \Gamma'$. Since $\Gamma'$ is generated by $B'$, there is an element $b' \in B'$ such that $x \in b' \subseteq b$.

**Lemma 13.4**
The topologies of $\mathbb{R}_l$ and $\mathbb{R}_K$ are strictly finer than standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$, but are not comparable with one another.

Let $\Gamma, \Gamma', \Gamma''$ be the topologies of $\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R}_l, \mathbb{R}_K$. Given a basis element $(a, b)$ for $\Gamma$ and a point $x \in (a, b)$, the basis element $[x, b) \in \Gamma'$ contains x and lies in $(a, b)$. On the other hand, given the basis element $[x, d) \in \Gamma'$, there is no open interval that contains x and lies in $[x , d)$. Thus, $\Gamma'$ is strictly finer than $\Gamma$. Similar argument follows for $\mathbb{R}_K$.

**Subbasis**
Define $\beta$ as the collection of all finite intersections of elements of S.
Given $x \in X$, it belongs to an element of S and hence to an element of $\beta$. This is the first condition of a basis. Let $B_1 = S_1 \cap ... \cap S_m$ and $B_2 = S_1' \cap ... \cap S_n'$ be two elements of $\beta$. Their intersection is also a finite intersection of elements of S, so it belongs to $\beta$. Thus, S is a basis and so generates a topology.

## 0.2 The Order Topology
---
### Definitions
- **Order Topology**
  - Let X be a set with simple order relation with more than one element. Let B be the collection of:
  - (1) (a, b) in X.
  - (2) $[a_0, b)$, where $a_0$ is the smallest element of X.
  - (3) $(a, b_0]$, where $b_0$ is the largest element of X.
  - Then B is a basis for X.
- **Rays**
  - If X is an ordered set, and $a \in X$, then there are four subsets of X called rays:
  - $(a, \infty) = \{x : x > a\}$,
  - $(-\infty, a) = \{x : x < a\}$,
  - $[a, \infty) = \{x : x \ge a\}$,
  - $(-\infty, a] = \{x : x \le a\}$.

### Theorems & Proofs
**Subbasis From Open Rays**
Because the open rays are open in the order topology, the topology they generate is contained in the order topology. On the other hand, every basis element for the order topology equals a finite intersection of open rays; the interval (a, b) equals the intersection of $(-\infty, b)$ and $(a, \infty)$, while $[a_0, b)$ and $(a, b_0]$, if they exist, are themselves open rays. Hence the topology generated by the open rays contains the order topology. **Q.E.D**

## 0.3 The Product Topology On $X \times Y$
---
### Definitions
- **Product Topology**
  - The topology on $X \times Y$ has basis collection of all sets of the form $U \times V$, where U is an open subset of X and V is an open subset of Y.
- **Projections**
  - Let $\pi_1 : X \times Y \to X$ be defined by $\pi_1(x, y) = x$ and let $\pi_1 : X \times Y \to Y$ be defined by $\pi_2(x, y) = y$.
  - These are projections of $X \times Y$ into its first and second factors.

### Theorems & Proofs
**Product Topology Basis**
Let B be the basis. The first condition is trivial. The intersection of any two basis elements is another basis element because $(U_1 \times V_1) \cap (U_2 \times V_2) = (U_1 \cap U_2) \times (V_1 \cap V_2)$.

**Theorem 15.1**
If B is a basis for the topology of X and C is a basis for the topology of Y, the the collection $D = \{b \times c : b \in B, c \in C\}$ is a basis for the topology of $X \times Y$.

We apply Lemma 13.2. Given an open set $W$ of $X \times Y$ and a point $x \times y$ of W, by definition of the product topology there is a basis element $U \times V$ such that $x \times y \in U \times V \subseteq W$. Because B and C are bases for X and Y, we can choose an element b of B such that $x \in b \subseteq U$, and an element c of C such that $y \in c \subseteq V$. Then $x \times y \in b \times c \subseteq W$. Thus the collection D meets the criterion of Lemma 13.2, so D is a basis for $X \times Y$. **Q.E.D**

**Theorem 15.2**
The collection $S = \{\pi_1^{-1} (U) : \text{U open in X}\} \cup \{\pi_2^{-1}(V): \text{V open in Y}\}$ is a subbasis for the product topology on $X \times Y$. 

Let $\Gamma$ denote the product topology on $X \times Y$, let $\Gamma'$ be the topology generated by S. Because every element of S belongs to $\Gamma$, so do arbitrary unions of finite intersections of elements of S. Thus $\Gamma' \subseteq \Gamma$. On the other hand, every basis element $U \times V$ for the topology $\Gamma$ is a finite intersection of elements of S, since $U \times V = \pi_1^{-1}(U) \cap \pi_2^{-1}(V)$. Therefore, $U \times V$ belongs to $\Gamma'$, so that $\Gamma \subseteq \Gamma'$ as well. **Q.E.D**

### Theorems & Proofs
**Lemma 16.1**
If B is a basis for the topology on X the the collection $B_Y = \{b \cap Y : b \in B\}$ is a basis for the subspace topology on X.

Given U open in X and given $y \in U \cap Y$, we can choose an element b of B such that $y \in b \subseteq U$. Then $y \in b \cap Y \subseteq U \cap Y$. It follows from Lemma 13.2 that $B_Y$ is a basis for the subspace topology on Y. $\blacksquare$

**Lemma 16.2**
Let Y be a subspace of X. If U is open in Y and Y is open in X, then U is open in X.

Since U is open in Y, $U = Y \cap V$ for some V open in X. Since Y and V are both open in X, so is $Y \cap V$. $\blacksquare$

**Theorem 16.3**
If A is a subspace of X and B is a subspace of Y, then the product topology on $A \times B$ is the same as the topology $A \times B$ inherits as a subspace of $X \times Y$.
