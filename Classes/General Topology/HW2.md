Define $\Gamma$ as the topology on $\mathbb{R}^2_{dict}$ and $\Gamma'$ as the product topology on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$. We can show that $\Gamma' \subset \Gamma$ (strictly). Consider $(a, b) \in \mathbb{R}^2$. For $(c, d) \times (e, f)$ of the basis of the product topology, suppose that $(a, b) \in (c, d) \times (e, f)$. It follows that $c < a < d$ and $e < b < f$. But there is a basis element of the dictionary order topology $((a, e), (a, f))$ which contains $(a, b)$ and is a subset of $(c, d) \times (e, f)$. Therefore, by Lemma 13.3 we get $\Gamma' \subseteq \Gamma$. Now consider $(1, 2) \in \mathbb{R}^2$. By definition, $((1, 1), (1, 3))$ is a basis for the dictionary topology and contains $(1, 2)$. Define arbitrary basis element of the product topology $(c, d) \times (e, f)$. Suppose $(1, 2) \in (c, d) \times (e, f)$. It follows that $c < 1 < d$ and $e < 2 < f$. But then we see that $(\frac{d + 1}{2}, 2) \in (c, d) \times (e, f)$ and $(\frac{d + 1}{2}, 2) \not \in ((1, 1), (1, 3))$ because $d + 1 > 2$ so that $\frac{d + 1}{2} > 1$. Therefore, by Lemma 13.3 we get $\Gamma \not \subseteq \Gamma'$. Thus, we conclude that $\Gamma' \subset \Gamma$ (strictly). $\blacksquare$

Pick $x_1, x_2 \in X$ such that $x_1 \ne x_2$. WLOG, let $x_1 < x_2$. Case 1: there is a $\epsilon$ such that $x_1 < \epsilon < x_2$ where $\epsilon \in X$. Then define $U_1 = (-\infty, \epsilon)$ and $U_2 = (\epsilon, \infty)$. Clearly, $U_1 \cap U_2 = \emptyset$ and since $x_1 < \epsilon < x_2$, we get that $x_1 \in U_1$ and $x_2 \in U_2$. Case 2: there is not a $\epsilon$ such that $x_1 < \epsilon < x_2$ where $\epsilon \in X$. Then define $U_1 = (-\infty, x_2)$ and $U_2 = (x_1, \infty)$. We see that since $x_1 < x_2$, we get $x_1 \in U_1$ and $x_2 \in U_2$. Also, $U_1 = (-\infty, x_1]$ and $U_2 = [x_2, \infty)$ because no element in X exists between $x_1$ and $x_2$. Therefore, $U_1 \cap U_2 = \emptyset$. But then we have shown that the order topology on any set X is Hausdorff. $\blacksquare$

3)
Let X be a set with infinite cardinality. Define $\Gamma$ as the finite complement topology on X. Consider $x_1, x_2 \in X$ and suppose $x_1 \ne x_2$. Define arbitrary open sets $U_1$ and $U_2$ of X. Suppose $x_1 \in U_1$ and $x_2 \in U_2$. It follows that $X - U_1$ and $X - U_2$ is finite because they can not be all of X from $U_1$ and $U_2$ not being empty. By definition, $X - (U_1 \cap U_2)$ must be finite or all of X. We see that  $X - U_1 \cup X - U_2 \equiv X - (U_1 \cap U_2)$ is finite because we took the finite union of finite elements. Therefore, $U_1 \cap U_2 \ne \emptyset$ because if so, $X - (U_1 \cap U_2)$ would be infinite which is a contradiction. $\blacksquare$

4)
$f: X \to Y$ is an open map if for every open set U of X, the set $f(U)$ is open in Y. Consider the map $\pi_1 : X \times Y \to X$ and let $U \times V$ be an open set of the basis of $X \times Y$. Then $\pi_1(U \times V) = U$ which is open in X by definition and so $\pi_1$ is an open map because open sets are unions of basis elements. Consider the map $\pi_2 : X \times Y \to Y$ and let $U \times V$ be an open set of the basis of $X \times Y$. Then $\pi_2(U \times V) = V$ which is open in Y by definition and so $\pi_2$ is an open map because open sets are unions of basis elements. $\blacksquare$

5)
Suppose Y is a subspace of X and A is a subset of Y. Let B be a basis for X. Then a basis for A as a subspace for X is $\{U \cap A : U \in B\}$. The basis for Y as a subspace of X is $\{U \cap Y : U \in B\}$. It follows that a basis for A as a subspace of Y is $\{(U \cap Y) \cap A : U \in B\}$. But $Y \cap A = A$ because $A \subseteq Y$ and so $\{(U \cap Y) \cap A : U \in B\} = \{U \cap A : U \in B\}$. Therefore, the topology A inherits as a subspace of Y is the same as the topology it inherits as a subspace of X because the bases for both are the same. $\blacksquare$

Let $I = [0,1]$. We compare three topologies: $\mathcal{T}_1 :=$ product topology on $I \times I$, $\mathcal{T}_2 :=$ dictionary order topology on $I \times I$, and $\mathcal{T}_3 :=$ $I \times I$ subspace topology from $\mathbb{R}^2_{dict}$.

($\mathcal{T}_2 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_3$) Let $B = ((a,b), (c,d))$ be a basis element of $\mathcal{T}_2$ where $(x, y) \in B$. Consider the same interval $U = ((a,b), (c,d))$ in $\mathbb{R}^2_{dict}$. Then $U \cap (I \times I) = B$ since we have $(x,y) \in U \cap (I \times I)$ iff $(a,b) < (x,y) < (c,d)$ (of dictionary comparison), which is exactly $B$. Thus every basis element of $\mathcal{T}_2$ is in $\mathcal{T}_3$.
($\mathcal{T}_3 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$) Let $U \cap (I \times I)$ be a basis element of $\mathcal{T}_3$ where $U = ((a,b), (c,d))$ is a basis element of $\mathbb{R}^2_{dict}$. Then $U \cap (I \times I) = (\max\{(a,b), (0,0)\}, \min\{(c,d), (1,1)\})$ in $I \times I$, which is a basis element of $\mathcal{T}_2$. Therefore every basis element of $\mathcal{T}_3$ is in $\mathcal{T}_2$. Thus, $\mathcal{T}_2 = \mathcal{T}_3$ because both have the same basis.

Let $(x,y) \in U \times V$ where $U \times V$ is a product topology basis element. Since $U, V$ are open in $I$, there exist intervals such that $x \in (a,b) \subseteq U$ and $y \in (c,d) \subseteq V$. Consider $B = ((x,c), (x,d))$, a dictionary topology basis element. Clearly $(x,y) \in B$ since $c < y < d$. For any $(x',y') \in B$,  $x' = x$ and $c < y' < d$. Thus $(x',y') \in U \times V$, so $B \subseteq U \times V$. By Lemma 13.3, $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$. It follows that $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_3$ too. Consider $(1/2, 1/2)$ and the dictionary basis element $B = ((1/2, 0), (1/2, 1))$ containing it. Let $U \times V$ be any product basis element with $(1/2, 1/2) \in U \times V$. Then there exist $a < 1/2 < b$ and $c < 1/2 < d$ with $(a,b) \subseteq U$ and $(c,d) \subseteq V$. Choose $x = (1/2 + b)/2 > 1/2$. Then $(x, 1/2) \in U \times V$ since $x \in (a,b)$ and $1/2 \in (c,d)$. However, $(x, 1/2) \notin B$ because $x > 1/2$. Thus $U \times V \not\subseteq B$, so by Lemma 13.3, $\mathcal{T}_2 \not\subseteq \mathcal{T}_1$. We therefore have $\mathcal{T}_1 \subset \mathcal{T}_2$ (strictly).

Therefore, $\mathcal{T}_1 \subset \mathcal{T}_2 = \mathcal{T}_3$ (where the subset is strict). $\blacksquare$
