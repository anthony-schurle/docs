Define $\Gamma$ as the topology on $\mathbb{R}^2_{dict}$ and $\Gamma'$ as the product topology on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$. We can show that $\Gamma' \subset \Gamma$ (strictly). Consider $(a, b) \in \mathbb{R}^2$. For $(c, d) \times (e, f)$ of the basis of the product topology, suppose that $(a, b) \in (c, d) \times (e, f)$. It follows that $c < a < d$ and $e < b < f$. But there is a basis element of the dictionary order topology $((a, e), (a, f))$ which contains $(a, b)$ and is a subset of $(c, d) \times (e, f)$. Therefore, by Lemma 13.3 we get $\Gamma' \subseteq \Gamma$. Now consider $(1, 2) \in \mathbb{R}^2$. By definition, $((1, 1), (1, 3))$ is a basis for the dictionary topology and contains $(1, 2)$. Define arbitrary basis element of the product topology $(c, d) \times (e, f)$. Suppose $(1, 2) \in (c, d) \times (e, f)$. It follows that $c < 1 < d$ and $e < 2 < f$. But then we see that $(\frac{d + 1}{2}, 2) \in (c, d) \times (e, f)$ and $(\frac{d + 1}{2}, 2) \not \in ((1, 1), (1, 3))$ because $d + 1 > 2$ so that $\frac{d + 1}{2} > 1$. Therefore, by Lemma 13.3 we get $\Gamma \not \subseteq \Gamma'$. Thus, we conclude that $\Gamma' \subset \Gamma$ (strictly). $\blacksquare$

Pick $x_1, x_2 \in X$ such that $x_1 \ne x_2$. WLOG, let $x_1 < x_2$. Case 1: there is a $\epsilon$ such that $x_1 < \epsilon < x_2$ where $\epsilon \in X$. Then define $U_1 = (-\infty, \epsilon)$ and $U_2 = (\epsilon, \infty)$. Clearly, $U_1 \cap U_2 = \emptyset$ and since $x_1 < \epsilon < x_2$, we get that $x_1 \in U_1$ and $x_2 \in U_2$. Case 2: there is not a $\epsilon$ such that $x_1 < \epsilon < x_2$ where $\epsilon \in X$. Then define $U_1 = (-\infty, x_2)$ and $U_2 = (x_1, \infty)$. We see that since $x_1 < x_2$, we get $x_1 \in U_1$ and $x_2 \in U_2$. Also, $U_1 = (-\infty, x_1]$ and $U_2 = [x_2, \infty)$ because no element in X exists between $x_1$ and $x_2$. Therefore, $U_1 \cap U_2 = \emptyset$. But then we have shown that the order topology on any set X is Hausdorff. $\blacksquare$

Let X be a set with infinite cardinality. Define $\Gamma$ as the finite complement topology on X. Consider $x_1, x_2 \in X$ and suppose $x_1 \ne x_2$. Define arbitrary open sets $U_1$ and $U_2$ of X. Suppose $x_1 \in U_1$ and $x_2 \in U_2$. It follows that $X - U_1$ and $X - U_2$ is finite because they can not be all of X from $U_1$ and $U_2$ not being empty. By definition, $X - (U_1 \cap U_2)$ must be finite or all of X. We see that  $X - U_1 \cup X - U_2 \equiv X - (U_1 \cap U_2)$ is finite because we took the finite union of finite elements. Therefore, $U_1 \cap U_2 \ne \emptyset$ because if so, $X - (U_1 \cap U_2)$ would be infinite which is a contradiction. $\blacksquare$

$f: X \to Y$ is an open map if for every open set U of X, the set $f(U)$ is open in Y. Consider the map $\pi_1 : X \times Y \to X$ and let $U \times V$ be an open set of the basis of $X \times Y$. Then $\pi_1(U \times V) = U$ which is open in X by definition and so $\pi_1$ is an open map because open sets are unions of basis elements. Consider the map $\pi_2 : X \times Y \to Y$ and let $U \times V$ be an open set of the basis of $X \times Y$. Then $\pi_2(U \times V) = V$ which is open in Y by definition and so $\pi_2$ is an open map because open sets are unions of basis elements. $\blacksquare$
