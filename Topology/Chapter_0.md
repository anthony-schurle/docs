## 0.0 Topological Spaces
---
### Definitions
- **Topology**
  - A topology on a set X is a collection $\Gamma$ of subsets of X having the following properties:
  - (1) $\emptyset, X \in \Gamma$.
  - (2) $\forall A (A \subseteq \Gamma \implies \bigcup_{a \in A} a \in \Gamma)$.
  - (3) $\forall A(A \subseteq \Gamma \land |A| < \infty \implies \bigcap_{a \in A} a \in \Gamma)$.
- **Topological Space**
  - Set X for which a topology $\Gamma$ has been specified.
  - Represented as an ordered pair $(X, \Gamma)$.
- **Open Set**
  - For $(X, \Gamma)$, we have $U \subseteq X$ and $U \in \Gamma$.
- **Discrete Topology**
  - $\Gamma = \mathcal{P}(X)$.
- **Trivial Topology**
  - $\Gamma = X, \emptyset$.
- **Multiple Topology**
  - Suppose $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ are two topologies on the set X.
  - If $\Gamma \subseteq \Gamma'$, then $\Gamma '$ is finer than $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma$ is coarser than $\Gamma '$.
  - If $\Gamma \subset \Gamma'$, then $\Gamma '$ is strictly finer than $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma$ is strictly coarser than $\Gamma '$.
  - If $\Gamma$ is comparable with $\Gamma '$ if either $\Gamma' \subseteq \Gamma$ or $\Gamma \subseteq \Gamma '$.

### Theorems & Proofs
**Finite Complement Topology**
Let $\Gamma$ be the collection of all subsets U of X such that $X - U$ is either finite or all of X. It is easy to see that $X, \emptyset \in \Gamma$. Define arbitrary family of nonempty elements $\{U_\alpha\} \subseteq \Gamma$. Notice,
$$
X \backslash \bigcup U_{\alpha} = \bigcap (X \backslash U_{\alpha})
$$
with the latter set being finite because each set $X \backslash U_{\alpha}$ is finite. Define arbitrary finite family of non-empty elements $\{U_\alpha\} \subseteq \Gamma$. Notice,
$$
X \backslash \bigcap U_\alpha = \bigcup (X \backslash U_\alpha)
$$
The latter set is a finite union of finite sets and, therefore, finite.

## 0.1 Basis For A Topology
---
### Definitions
- **Basis**
  - A basis for $(X, \Gamma)$ is a collection $\beta$ of subsets of X such that:
  - (1) $\forall x \in X \exists B \in \beta (x \in B)$.
  - (2) $\forall x \in X \forall B_1, B_2 \in \beta (x \in B_1 \cap B_2 \implies \exists B_3 \in \beta (x \in B_3 \land B_3 \subseteq B_1 \cap B_2))$.
  - To generate a topology, $\Gamma := \{U \subseteq X : \forall x \in U\exists B \in \beta (x \in B \land B \subseteq U)\}$.
- **Standard Topology**
  - Topology generated by the collection of all open intervals on $\mathbb{R}$.
  - $(a, b) = \{x : a < x < b\}$.
- **Lower Limit Topology**
  - Topology ($\mathbb{R}_l$) generated by the collection of all half-open intervals.
  - $[a, b) = \{x : a \leq x < b\}$.
- **k-Topology**
  - Topology ($\mathbb{R}_K$) generated by the collection of all open intervals along with all sets of the form (a, b) - K where K is the set of all numbers of the form $\frac{1}{n}$ for $n \in Z_+$.
- **SubBasis**
  - A subbasis S for a topology on X is a collection of subsets of X whose union equals X (axiom 1 of basis).
  - The topology generated is the collection of all unions of finite intersections of S.

### Theorems & Proofs
**Generated Topology**
The empty set satisfies the condition of openness vacuously. Likewise, $X \in \Gamma$, since for each $x \in X$, there is a basis element containing x and contained in X. Define arbitrary $\{U_a\}_{a\in J} \subseteq \Gamma$ and let $U = \bigcup_{a \in J}U_a$. Given $x \in U$, there is an index $\alpha$ such that $x \in U_\alpha$. But $U_\alpha$ is open, so there is some basis element B where $x \in B \subseteq U_\alpha$. It follows that $x \in B \land B \subseteq U$ and so by definition, $U \in \Gamma$. Now take two elements $U_1, U_2$ of $\Gamma$. Given $x \in U_1 \cap U_2$, choose a basis element $B_1$ containing x such that $B_1 \subseteq U_1$; choose also a basis element $B_2$ containing x such that $B_2 \subseteq U_2$. Then the second condition of a basis allows us to choose $B_3$ containing x such that $B_3 \subseteq B_1 \cap B_2$. Then $x \in B_3$ and $B_3 \subseteq U_1 \cap U_2$ so $U_1 \cap U_2 \in \Gamma$. Finally, we show by induction that any finite intersection $U_1 \cap ... \cap U_n$ of elements of $\Gamma$ is in $\Gamma$. This is trivial for $n = 1$. Suppose it is true for $n - 1$. We have $(U_1 \cap ... \cap U_n) = (U_1 \cap ... \cap U_{n - 1}) \cap U_n$. By hypothesis, $U_1 \cap ... \cap U_{n - 1} \in \Gamma$. But we showed $U_1 \cap U_2 \in \Gamma$ for arbitrary $U_1$ and $U_2$ so $(U_1 \cap ... \cap U_{n - 1}) \cap U_n \in \Gamma$. Thus, $\Gamma$ is a topology. 

**Lemma 13.1**
Let X be a set; let $\beta$ be a basis for $(X, \Gamma)$. Then $\Gamma$ is the collection of all unions of elements of $\beta$.

Given a collection of elements of $\beta$, they are also elements of $\Gamma$. Because $\Gamma$ is a topology, their union is in $\Gamma$. Conversely, given $U \in \Gamma$. Choose for each $x \in U$ an element $B_x \in \beta$ such that $x \in B_x \subseteq U$. Then $U = \bigcup_{x \in U}B_x$, so U equals a union of elements of $\beta$.

**Lemma 13.2**
Let X be a topological space. Suppose that C is a collection of open sets of X such that for each open set U of X and each x in U, there is an element c of C such that $x \in c \subseteq U$. Then C is a basis for the topology of X.

Given $x \in X$, since X itself is an open set, there is by hypothesis an element $c \in C$ such that $x \in c \subseteq X$. Let $x \in c_1 \cap c_2$ for $c_1, c_2 \in C$. Since $c_1$ and $c_2$ are open, so is $c_1 \cap c_2$. Therefore, there exists by hypothesis an element $c_3$ in C such that $x \in c_3 \subseteq c_1 \cap c_2$. Thus, C is a basis.
Let $\Gamma$ be the collection of open sets of X. Define $\Gamma'$ as the topology generated by C. Suppose $U \in \Gamma$. If $x \in U$, then there is a $c \in C$ such that $x \in c \subseteq U$. By definition, $U \in \Gamma'$. Conversely, suppose $W \in \Gamma '$. Then W is a union of elements of C by the preceding lemma. Since each element of C belongs to $\Gamma$, W also belongs to $\Gamma$.

**Lemma 13.3**
Let $B$ and $B'$ be bases for the topologies $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ on X. The following are equivalent:
(1) $\Gamma'$ is finer than $\Gamma$.
(2) $\forall x \in X \forall b \in B (x \in b \implies \exists b' \in B' (x \in b' \subseteq b))$.

($(2) \implies (1)$) Given $U \in \Gamma$, we wish to show $U \in \Gamma'$. Let $x \in U$. Since $B$ generates $\Gamma$, there is an element $b \in B$ such that $x \in b \subseteq U$. Condition (2) tell us that there is some $b' \in B'$ such that $x \in b' \subseteq b$. Then $x \in b' \subseteq U$, so $U \in \Gamma'$ be definition.
($(1) \implies (2)$) We are given $x \in X$ and $b \in B$, with $x \in b$. b belongs to $\Gamma$ by definition and $\Gamma \subseteq \Gamma'$ by condition (1); therefore $b \in \Gamma'$. Since $\Gamma'$ is generated by $B'$, there is an element $b' \in B'$ such that $x \in b' \subseteq b$.

**Lemma 13.4**
The topologies of $\mathbb{R}_l$ and $\mathbb{R}_K$ are strictly finer than standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$, but are not comparable with one another.

Let $\Gamma, \Gamma', \Gamma''$ be the topologies of $\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R}_l, \mathbb{R}_K$. Given a basis element $(a, b)$ for $\Gamma$ and a point $x \in (a, b)$, the basis element $[x, b) \in \Gamma'$ contains x and lies in $(a, b)$. On the other hand, given the basis element $[x, d) \in \Gamma'$, there is no open interval that contains x and lies in $[x , d)$. Thus, $\Gamma'$ is strictly finer than $\Gamma$. Similar argument follows for $\mathbb{R}_K$.

**Subbasis**
Define $\beta$ as the collection of all finite intersections of elements of S.
Given $x \in X$, it belongs to an element of S and hence to an element of $\beta$. This is the first condition of a basis. Let $B_1 = S_1 \cap ... \cap S_m$ and $B_2 = S_1' \cap ... \cap S_n'$ be two elements of $\beta$. Their intersection is also a finite intersection of elements of S, so it belongs to $\beta$. Thus, S is a basis and so generates a topology.
