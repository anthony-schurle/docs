1)Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $V = \{0, 1\}^n$ ; thus, V is the set of all 0 − 1 sequences of length n. The graph on V in which two such sequences form an edge iff they differ in exactly one position is called the n-dimensional cube or n-dimensional hypercube, and is sometimes denoted $H_n$. Determine the average degree, number of edges, diameter, girth, and circumference of this graph. (Hint for the circumference: induct on n.)

($d(H_n)$)
$d(H_n) = n$
Let $v \in V(H_n)$. By definition $d(v) = n$ because there are n potential elements of v that can differ, and only one can at a time. It follows that because v was arbitrary, all vertices have degree n. Therefore, $d(H_n) = \frac{\sum_{v \in V(H_n)}d(v)}{|V(H_n)|} = \frac{|V(H_n)|d(v)}{|V(H_n)|} = d(v) = n$.

($||H_n||$)
We show $|V(H_n)| = 2^n$. Let $n = 1$. We see that the only possible 0-1 sequences of length 1 are $\{0\}$ and $\{1\}$. Now suppose $|V(H_n)| = 2^n$. For each $v \in V(H_n)$, append 0 at the end of the sequence. This is a combination of length n + 1. Each such combination is still unique because the first n digits of all sequences are unique. Similar reasoning follows for appending 1 at the end of each sequence. The group of 0s appended and the group of 1s appended are also unique from each other because of the last appended digit. But we have then doubled our total sequences and so $|V(H_{n+1})| = 2 \times 2^n = 2^{n+1}$. Therefore, $|V(H_n)| = 2^n$. It follows that $||H_n|| = 0.5d(H_n)|V(H_n)| = 0.5n2^{n} = n2^{n-1}$.

($diam(G)$)
Take arbitrary $x := \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\}, y := \{y_1, y_2, ..., y_n\} \in V(H_n)$. We first find a path $xPy$ and then show it is shortest. Find the first $x_i \ne y_i$ for $i \le n$. Move to a neighbor of x such that $x_i = y_i$, which exists by definition of the edges in the graph. Continue for the next $x_i \ne y_i$ until y is reached. Then $xPy$ has been found. A vertex was traversed for each $x_i \ne y_i$ and so $xP^ky$ where $k := \sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i + y_i)mod(2)$. Suppose a shorter path T existed such that $xTy$. Then T at least one element in P where $x_i \ne y_i$ was not traversed.  But this is not possible by definition of edges and so T does not exist. k is maximized clearly when $x_i$ and $y_i$ are different for all i which sums to 1. So $k = n(1) = n$. Therefore, $diam(G) = n$.

($g(H_n)$)
Case 1: $n \ge 2$. Take $x := \{0, 0, ..., 0\} \in V(H_n)$. There is a neighbor $y := \{0, 1, 0, ..., 0\}$ of x. Also, there is a neighbor $z := \{1, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0\}$ of y. Continuing, there is a $f := \{1, 0, 0, ..., 0\}$ of z. Notice f is a neighbor of x. So we have a cycle $xyzfx$ and its length is 4. Suppose we had a shorter cycle with length 3. Then it can be defined by the vertices vnmv. Then there is some k such that $v_k \ne n_k$. Continuing, there is some $l \ne k$ - else we return to v - such that $n_l \ne m_l$. It follows that there is some $p \ne l$ - else we return to m - such that $m_p \ne v_p$ and m is a neighbor of v. But this is a contradiction because m differs from v by at least two digits and so can not be neighbors. Thus, $g(H_n) = 4$.

(Circumference)
We show the circumference is $2^n$ by induction. For $n = 1$, there's only two vertices so there's no cycle. For $n = 2$, we get a square with 4 vertices so the circumference is $4 = 2^2$. Now suppose the circumference of $H_n$ is $2^n$. By the construction from before, $H_{n+1}$ has two copies of $H_n$ - call them $H_n^0$ (with 0 appended) and $H_n^1$ (with 1 appended). Each copy has a longest cycle of length $2^n$ by the inductive hypothesis. Take the longest cycle $C = v_1v_2...v_{2^n}v_1$ in $H_n^0$. Pick two neighbors in this cycle, say $v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$. They differ in exactly one of the first $n$ positions by definition. Their partners $v_i'$ and $v_{i+1}'$ in $H_n^1$ also differ in that same position, so they're neighbors too. Also $v_i$ and $v_i'$ are neighbors because they only differ in the last bit. Same for $v_{i+1}$ and $v_{i+1}'$. So we can make a bigger cycle by going $v_1$ through $v_i$ in $H_n^0$, then jump to $v_i'$, go to $v_{i+1}'$ in $H_n^1$, jump back to $v_{i+1}$, and finish through $v_{2^n}$ back to $v_1$. This gets all $2^n$ vertices from $H_n^0$ and all $2^n$ from $H_n^1$, so the cycle has length $2^{n+1}$. Since there are only $2^{n+1}$ vertices total in $H_{n+1}$, this is the longest possible cycle. Therefore the circumference of $H_{n+1}$ is $2^{n+1}$.

2)Let G be a graph. If $\delta(G) = d \ge 2$ and $g(G) = g \in \mathbb{N}$, prove that $$ |G| \ge \begin{cases} 1 + d\sum_{i = 0}^{r - 1}(d - 1)^i & \text{if } 2r + 1 := g,\ 2\sum_{i = 0}^{r - 1}(d - 1)^i & \text{if } 2r := g. \end{cases} $$

Case 1: $g = 2r + 1$ (odd girth). Pick arbitrary $v \in V(G)$. Define $N_i$ to be the vertices at distance exactly $i$ from $v$. Clearly $|N_0| = 1$ (just v) and $|N_1| \ge d$ because $d(v) \ge d$ by definition. For $i \ge 2$, take any $u \in N_{i-1}$. Since $d(u) \ge d$, vertex u has at least $d$ neighbors. One of those neighbors is in $N_{i-2}$ (from the path back to $v$). The other at least $d-1$ neighbors can't be in $N_{i-1}$ or earlier because that would make a cycle shorter than $2r+1$, which contradicts the girth. So they must all be in $N_i$. This means $|N_i| \ge |N_{i-1}|(d-1)$. Therefore $|N_i| \ge d(d-1)^{i-1}$ for $i \ge 1$. It follows that $$|G| \ge \sum_{i=0}^{r} |N_i| \ge 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{r} d(d-1)^{i-1} = 1 + d\sum_{i=0}^{r-1}(d-1)^i$$

Case 2: $g = 2r$ (even girth). Pick arbitrary edge $e = uv \in E(G)$. Define $N_i^u$ to be vertices at distance exactly $i$ from $u$, and $N_i^v$ to be vertices at distance exactly $i$ from $v$. Since the girth is $2r$, the sets $N_i^u$ and $N_j^v$ can't share vertices when $i + j < 2r - 1$ because that would make a cycle shorter than $2r$. So for $i < r$, the sets $N_i^u$ and $N_i^v$ are disjoint. We have $|N_0^u| = 1$ and $|N_0^v| = 1$. Also $|N_1^u| \ge d-1$ because $u$ has degree at least $d$ and one edge goes to $v$. Same reasoning gives $|N_1^v| \ge d-1$. For $i \ge 2$, similar to Case 1, we get $|N_i^u| \ge (d-1)^i$ and $|N_i^v| \ge (d-1)^i$. Therefore $$|G| \ge \sum_{i=0}^{r-1}|N_i^u| + \sum_{i=0}^{r-1}|N_i^v| = 2\sum_{i=0}^{r-1}(d-1)^i$$

3)Determine $\kappa(G)$ and $\lambda(G)$ for $G = P_n, C_n, K_n, K_{m, n}$, and $H_n$ where $n, m \ge 3$.

($P_n$)
Let $P_n$ be represented by $x_1x_2...x_n$.
By Proposition 1.4.2, we see that $\kappa(P_n) \le \lambda(P_n) \le 1$. But $P_n$ is assumed to non-trivial and it is connected by definition, so $\kappa(P_n) \ge 1$. It follows that $\kappa(P_n) = \lambda(P_n) = 1$.

($C_n$) 
Let $C_n$ be represented by $x_1x_2...x_nx_1$.
By Proposition 1.4.2, we see that $\kappa(C_n) \le \lambda(C_n) \le 2$.  Consider arbitrary $v \in V(C_n)$ where we have $G := C_n - \{v\}$. Represent this G as $y_1y_2...y_{n-1}$. Clearly, this a path which is connected by definition. Therefore, $\kappa(C_n) \ge 2$ It follows that $\kappa(C_n) = \lambda(C_n) = 2$.

($K_n$)
By Proposition 1.4.2, we see that $\kappa(K_n) \le \lambda(K_n) \le n-1$. Suppose $\kappa(K_n) = n - 2$. Then we pick $k_1, k_2, ..., k_{n-2} \in V(K_n)$ such that $K_n - \{k_1, k_2, ..., k_{n-2}\}$ is disconnected. Notice that leaves $v_1, v_2 \in (K_n - \{k_1, k_2, ..., k_{n-2}\})$ which are adjacent by definition of the complete graph, and so connected. This is a contradiction and so it must be that $\kappa(K_n) \ge n - 1$. Thus, $\kappa(K_n) = \lambda(K_n) = n - 1$.

($K_{m, n}$)
WLOG, assume $m \le n$. Pick arbitrary $v \in K_{m,n}$. By definition, $|N(v)| = n$ or $|N(v)| = m$. It follows that $\delta(K_{m, n})$ is $min(m, n) = m$ since each vertex has either m or n neighbors. By Proposition 1.4.2, we see that $\kappa(K_{m,n}) \le \lambda(K_{m,n}) \le m$. Suppose $\kappa(K_{m,n}) = m - 1$. Then we pick $k_1, k_2, ..., k_{m-1} \in V(K_{m,n})$ such that $V(K_{m,n}) - \{k_1, k_2, ..., k_{m-1}\}$ is disconnected. But since $|\{k_1, k_2, ..., k_{m-1}\}| < m \le n$, this is just a graph $K_{x, y}$ where $x + y = n + 1 \ge 4$ and $x \ge 1$ and $y \ge 1$. Pick arbitrary $v_1, v_2 \in K_{x,y}$. If $v_1$ lies in partition x and $v_2$ in y, then by definition they are connected. Similar reasoning follows for if $v_1$ lies in partition y and $v_2$ in x. If $v_1,v_2$ both lie in partition x, then there is a vertex in partition y they both share - by definition of the graph and because $y \ge 1$ - and so both are connected. Similar reasoning follows for when both are in partition y. Therefore, this graph is connected which is a contradiction. It follows that $\kappa(K_{m,n}) \ge m$. Thus, $\kappa(K_{m,n}) = \lambda(K_{m,n}) = m$.

($H_n$)
($H_n$)
By Proposition 1.4.2 and problem 1, we see that $\kappa(H_n) \le \lambda(H_n) \le n$. Suppose $\kappa(H_n) = n - 1$. Then we pick $h_1, h_2, ..., h_{n-1} \in V(H_n)$ such that $G := H_n - \{h_1, h_2, ..., h_{n-1}\}$ is disconnected. Now pick arbitrary $x, y \in V(G)$ from different components. Let x be defined as $(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ and y as $(y_1, y_2, ..., y_n)$. We construct $n$ vertex-disjoint paths from $x$ to $y$ in $H_n$. For each $j \in \{1, 2, ..., n\}$, define path $P_j$ as follows: starting at $x$, flip bit $j$ to match $y_j$, then flip each subsequent bit $i > j$ where $x_i \ne y_i$ to match $y_i$, then flip each bit $i < j$ where $x_i \ne y_i$ to match $y_i$. Each path $P_j$ has length at most $n$ and the paths are vertex-disjoint except at their endpoints $x$ and $y$ because they each flip bit $j$ at different stages. Since there are $n$ such vertex-disjoint paths and we removed only $n - 1$ vertices from $H_n$, at least one path remains intact in $G$. Therefore $x$ and $y$ are connected in $G$, contradicting that they are in different components. Thus, $\kappa(H_n) \ge n$. It follows that $\kappa(H_n) = \lambda(H_n) = n$.

4)
a) Show that every 2-connected graph contains a cycle.

Call the graph G. Take arbitrary $x, y \in V(G)$. 
Case 1: x and y are not neighbors. Because G is 2-connected, there is some path $xPy$ linking x and y. Now pick $v \in xPy$ where $v \ne  x \land v \ne y$. Consider the graph $G - v$ which must have a path $xWy$ because G is 2-connected. Notice $xWy \ne xPy$ because $v \not \in V(G - v)$. We then found cycle $C := xPyWx$.
Case 2: x and y are neighbors. Pick arbitrary $v \in V(G)$ where $v \ne x \land v \ne y$. By connectivity there exists a path $xPv$ and $vWy$. But then we found cycle $C := xPvWyx$.
Thus, every 2-connected graph contains a cycle.

b)Show the (i) $\iff$ (iv) implication of Theorem 1.5.1.

($\implies$) Suppose T is a tree which is acyclic by definition. Pick arbitrary non-adjacent $t_1, t_2 \in T$. There exists $t_1Pt_2$ by definition. But then $T + t_1t_2$ creates cycle $t_1Pt_2t_1$ and since $t_1,t_2$ were arbitrary, T is maximally acyclic. ($\Longleftarrow$) Suppose T is maximally acyclic. Now suppose T was not connected. Then there exists some $t_1, t_2 \in V(T)$ with infinite distance. Now consider $T + t_1t_2$, which is a graph with a subgraph containing the bridge $t_1t_2$. This subgraph does not contain a cycle because a bridge does not lie on a cycle and it was acyclic to begin with. But T was maximally acyclic and so this is a contradiction. Therefore, T is connected, and by definition a tree.

5)Show that every automorphism of a tree fixes a vertex or an edge.

Let T be a tree and φ be an automorphism of T. Pick a longest path P in T. Case 1: P has odd length $2r+1$. Let $P = v_0v_1...v_{2r+1}$. Consider the middle vertex $c = v_{r+1}$. Since φ is an automorphism, it preserves distances by definition. So φ maps longest paths to longest paths. The vertex c is distance $r+1$ from both endpoints $v_0$ and $v_{2r+1}$. Since any longest path has length $2r+1$, its middle vertex also has this property. Therefore φ must map c to some middle vertex of a longest path. But c is the only vertex on P with this distance property, so φ(c) = c. Thus c is fixed. Case 2: P has even length $2r$. Let $P = v_0v_1...v_{2r}$. Consider the middle edge $e = v_rv_{r+1}$. Since φ preserves distances and maps longest paths to longest paths, it must map middle edges to middle edges. The vertices $v_r$ and $v_{r+1}$ are both distance $r$ from $v_0$ and distance $r$ from $v_{2r}$. This means φ maps the edge ${v_r, v_{r+1}}$ to ${v_r, v_{r+1}}$ by the same reasoning. So the edge e is fixed. Therefore every automorphism of a tree fixes a vertex or an edge.
