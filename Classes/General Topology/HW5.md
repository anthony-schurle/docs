1) Let $\{A_\alpha\}$ be a collection of subsets of X; let $X = \bigcup_\alpha A_\alpha$. Let $f : X \to Y$; suppose that $f | A_\alpha$ is continuous for each $\alpha$.
a) Show that if the collection $\{A_\alpha\}$ is finite and each set $A_\alpha$ is closed, then f is continuous.
Let V be a closed set in Y. Then $f^{-1}(V) \cap A_\alpha = (f | A_\alpha)^{-1}(V)$. Since $f | A_\alpha$ is continuous, the set is closed in $A_\alpha$, and hence closed in X because $A_\alpha$ is closed in X. But $f^{-1}(V) = \bigcup_\alpha(f^{-1}(V) \cap A_\alpha)$ so that $f^{-1}(V)$ is also closed in X. Therefore, f is continuous. $\blacksquare$

b) Find an example where the collection $\{A_\alpha\}$ is countable and each $A_\alpha$ is closed, but f is not continuous.
Define $f : [0, 1] \to \mathbb{N}$ to be $f(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if}, x = 0 \\ 1 & \text{if}, x > 0 \end{cases}$. Now consider the family $A_n = [\frac{1}{n + 1}, \frac{1}{n}]$ for $n \ge 1$ and $A_0 = \{0\}$ which are all closed and there are countable amount of family members whose union covers $[0, 1]$. Notice each $f|A_n$ is continuous for each n, but f is not continuous at 0 since $\text{limit}_{x \to 0^+}f(x) = 1$ but $f(0) = 0$. $\blacksquare$ 

c) Show that if the family $\{A_\alpha\}$ is locally finite and each $A_\alpha$ is closed, then f is continuous.
Let V be a closed set in Y. Notice $f^{-1}(V) = \bigcup_\alpha(f^{-1}(V) \cap A_\alpha)$. Since $f | A_\alpha$ is continuous and V is closed, each term in the union is closed in $A_\alpha$. Since $A_\alpha$ is closed in X, $f^{-1}(V) \cap A_\alpha$ is closed in X. Since $\{A_\alpha\}$ is locally finite, so is $\{f^{-1}(V) \cap A_\alpha\}$. For any x in X, let U be a neighborhood of x meeting only $A_{\alpha_1}, A_{\alpha_2}, ..., A_{\alpha_k}$. Then $U \cap f^{-1}(V) = U \cap \bigcup_{i = 1}^k (f^{-1}(V) \cap A_{\alpha_i})$ which is a finite union of closed sets intersected with U, and so closed in U. It follows that $f^{-1}(V)$ is closed in X. Thus, f is continuous. $\blacksquare$

2) Let $A \subseteq X$; let $f : A \to Y$ be continuous; let Y be Hausdorff. Show that if f may be extended to a continuous function $g : \overline{A} \to Y$, then g is uniquely determined by f.
Suppose f can be extended to g and another continuous function $p : \overline{A} \to Y$. Define $h : \overline{A} \to Y \times Y$ by $h(x) = (g(x), p(x))$. Since g and p are both continuous, h is continuous. Since Y is Hausdorff, $\{(y, y) : y \in Y\} \subseteq Y \times Y$ is closed (Ch 2, Problem 13). Therefore, $h^{-1}(\{(y, y) : y \in Y\}) = \{x \in \overline{A} : g(x) = p(x)\}$ is closed in $\overline{A}$. For any $x \in A$, $g(x) = f(x) = p(x)$ by definition of extension and so $A \subseteq \{x \in \overline{A} : g(x) = p(x)\}$. But this is a closed subset of $\overline{A}$ containing A, so $\overline{A} = \{x \in \overline{A} : g(x) = p(x)\}$. Thus, $g(x) = p(x)$ for all $x \in \overline{A}$. $\blacksquare$

3) Let $X = \mathbb{R}^2$, $A = \mathbb{R}^2 \backslash \{0\} \subseteq X$, $Y = \mathbb{R}^2 \backslash 0$, and $f: A \to Y$ be the map $f(x) = x$ for all x in A. Prove that f is continuous and Y is Hausdorff. Prove that there is no extension $f : A \to Y$ to a continuous map $g : \overline{A} \to Y$. Here we are viewing $\overline{A}$ as the closure of A in X.
Let $J$ be an open set of $Y$, which is $V \cap Y$ for some open $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$. Since $f^{-1}(V \cap Y) = V \cap A$, we see that $f^{-1}(J)$ is open in $A$, so $f$ is continuous. $Y$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^2$ which is Hausdorff, so $Y$ is Hausdorff. Notice that $\overline{A} = \mathbb{R}^2$ since every neighborhood of $0$ contains points of $A$. Suppose for contradiction that $g : \mathbb{R}^2 \to Y$ is a continuous extension of $f$. Let $(x_k)$ be any sequence in $A$ that converges to 0 in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Since each $x_k \in A$, we have $g(x_k) = f(x_k) = x_k$. By continuity of $g$, we must have $g(x_k)$ converging to  $g(0)$ in $Y$. But $g(x_k) = x_k$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and since limits are unique in $\mathbb{R}^2$, this forces $g(0) = 0$. However, $g(0) \in Y = \mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{0\}$, so $g(0) \neq 0$, a contradiction. Therefore no such continuous extension exists. $\blacksquare$

4) Let $x_1, x_2, ...$ be a sequence of the points of the product space $\prod X_\alpha$. Show that this sequence converges to the point x iff the sequence $\pi_\alpha (x_1), \pi_\alpha(x_2), ...$ converges to $\pi_\alpha(x)$ for each $\alpha$. Is this fact true if one uses the box topology instead of the product topology?
($\implies$) Suppose $x_1, x_2, ...$ converges to x in the product space. Since each $\pi_\alpha$ is continuous in the product topology, and continuous functions preserve convergence, we immeadiately see that $\pi_\alpha(x_1), \pi_\alpha(x_2), ...$ converges to $\pi_\alpha(x)$ for each $\alpha$.
($\Longleftarrow$) Suppose $\pi_\alpha(x_1), \pi_\alpha(x_2), ...$ converges to $\pi_\alpha(x)$ for each $\alpha$. Let U be a basis element containing x in the product topology. Then $U = \bigcap_{i = 1}^k \pi_\alpha^{-1}(U_{\alpha_i})$ where each $U_{\alpha_i}$ is open in $X_{\alpha_i}$. Because $\pi_{\alpha_i}(x_1), \pi_{\alpha_i}(x_2), ...$ converges to $\pi_{\alpha_i}(x)$, there is some $N_i$ such that $\pi_{\alpha_i}((x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)) \in U_{\alpha_i}$ for all $n \ge N_i$. Set $N = max(N_1, ..., N_k)$, for all $n \ge N$, we have$x_n \in U$. Thus $x_1, x_2, ...$ converges to x.

This is not true for the box topology. Define $(x_n)$ where $x_n = (0, 0, ..., \frac{1}{n}, 0, ...)$ with $\frac{1}{n}$ in the n-th coordinate and 0 elsewhere. Notice $\pi_k(x_n) = 0$ for all $n > k$ of fixed k, so it converges to $\pi_k(x) = 0$ where $x = (0, 0, ...)$. Define box set $U = \prod_{n=1}^\infty (\frac{-1}{n}, \frac{1}{n})$. This contains x, but for any fixed $x_n$, its n-th coordinate is $\frac{1}{n}$ which is not in $(\frac{-1}{n}, \frac{1}{n})$. So $x_n \not \in U$ for all n, meaning $x_1, x_2, ...$ does not converge to x in the box topology. $\blacksquare$

5) Let $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ be the subset of $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ consisting of all sequences $(x_1, x_2, ...)$ such that $x_i \ne 0$ for only finitely many values of i. What is the closure of $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ in $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ in the box and product topologies?
Let $U = \prod U_i$ be a basis element containing $(x_1, x_2, ...)$ so $U_i = \mathbb{R}$ for all but finitely many $i > N$. Define the sequence $y_i = x_i$ for $i \le N$ and $y_i = 0$ for $i > N$. Then $(y_1, y_2, ...) \in \mathbb{R}^\infty$ and $(y_1, y_2, ...) \in U$ since $y_i = x_i \in U_i$ for $i \le N$ and $y_i = 0 \in U_i$ for $i > N$. Thus every basis element containing $(x_1, x_2, ...)$ intersects $\mathbb{R}^\infty$, so $(x_1, x_2, ...) \in \overline{\mathbb{R}^\infty}$. Thus, the closure of $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ in the product topology is all of $\mathbb{R}^\omega$.

Let $(x_1, x_2, ...) \not \in \mathbb{R}^\infty$ so that $x_i \ne 0$ for infinitely many i. For each i where $x_i \ne 0$ let $U_i$ be an open interval around $x_i$ not containing 0. For each i where $x_i = 0$ let $U_i = \mathbb{R}$. Then $U = \prod U_i$ is open in the box topology and contains $(x_1, x_2, ...)$. $(y_1, y_2, ...) \not \in \mathbb{R}^\infty$ since any $(y_1, y_2, ...) \in U$ must have $y_i \in U_i$ for all i, and since $U_i$ excludes 0 for infinitely many i this is not possible. So $U \cap \mathbb{R}^\infty = \emptyset$ meaning the complement of $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ is open. Thus, $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ is closed in $\mathbb{R}^\omega$. We have $\overline{\mathbb{R}^\infty} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^\infty$ and $\mathbb{R}^\infty \subseteq \overline{\mathbb{R}^\infty}$ so that $\overline{\mathbb{R}^\infty} = \mathbb{R}^\infty$ in the box topology. $\blacksquare$
