1) Show that if A is closed in Y and Y is closed in X, then A is closed in X.

Suppose A is closed in Y and Y is closed in X. By theorem 17,2 it must be that $A = Y \cap U$ for some closed set U in X. Because Y is closed in X, and U is closed in X, we get $Y \cap U$ closed in X. Therefore, because this equals A, A is closed in X. $\blacksquare$

2) Let X be an ordered set in the order topology. Show that $\overline{(a, b)} \subseteq [a, b]$. Under what conditions does equality hold?

Define arbitrary x and suppose $x \in \overline{(a, b)}$. Notice, $[a, b]$ is a closed set of X because $X - [a,b] = (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty)$ which is open in X. But by definition of $x \in \overline{(a, b)}$, x is contained in every closed set containing $(a, b)$ - and $[a, b]$ contains this. Therefore, we see that $x \in [a, b]$. Thus, from x being arbitrary, we see that $\overline{(a, b)} \subseteq [a, b]$. $\blacksquare$

Equality holds iff $a, b \in \overline{(a, b)}$.
We have $\{a, b\} \subseteq \overline{(a, b)}$ since $a, b \in \overline{(a, b)}$. Therefore, $[a, b] = (a, b) \cup \{a, b\} \subseteq \overline{(a, b)}$ because $(a, b) \subseteq \overline{(a, b)}$. Thus, $[a, b] \subseteq \overline{(a, b)}$. 
Suppose $[a, b] = \overline{a, b}$. Since $a, b \in [a, b]$, we have $a, b \in \overline{(a, b)}$. $\blacksquare$

3) Let A, B, and $A_\alpha$ denote subsets of a space X. Prove the following.
a) $A \subseteq B \implies \overline A \subseteq \overline B$.
b) $\overline{A \cup B} = \overline A \cup \overline B$.
c)$\bigcup \overline{A_\alpha} \subseteq \overline{\bigcup A_\alpha}$.

a)
Suppose $A \subseteq B$. Let x be arbitrary and suppose $x \in \overline A$. By definition, x is contained in every closed set that contains A. But since $A \subseteq B$, every closed set that contains B also contains A. Therefore $x \in \overline B$ by definition. Since x was arbitrary, $A \subseteq B \implies \overline A \subseteq \overline B$. $\blacksquare$

b)
Let x be arbitrary.
($\subseteq$) Suppose $x \not \in \overline A \cup \overline B$. Then $x \not \in \overline A$ and $x \not \in \overline B$. So there is some closed set C that contains A but not x, and some closed set D that contains B but not x. It follows that $C \cup D$ is a closed set that does not contain x but contains $A \cup B$. Therefore $x \not \in \overline{A \cup B}$ by definition. Since x was arbitrary, $\overline{A \cup B} \subseteq \overline A \cup \overline B$.
($\supseteq$) Suppose $x \in \overline A \cup \overline B$. Then $x \in \overline A$ or $x \in \overline B$.  Case 1: $x \in \overline A$. Notice that $A \subseteq A \cup B$, so every closed set that contains $A \cup B$ also contains A. By definition, $x \in \overline{A \cup B}$.  Case 2 follows similarly. Therefore $\overline A \cup \overline B \subseteq \overline{A \cup B}$. $\blacksquare$

c)
Let x be arbitrary and suppose $x \in \bigcup \overline{A_\alpha}$. Then x is contained in some $\overline{A_{\alpha_0}}$ for some index $\alpha_0$, so x is contained in every closed set that contains $A_{\alpha_0}$. But $A_{\alpha_0} \subseteq \bigcup A_{\alpha}$, so every closed set containing $\bigcup A_{\alpha}$ also contains $A_{\alpha_0}$. Therefore $x \in \overline{\bigcup A_\alpha}$ by definition. Since x was arbitrary, $\bigcup \overline{A_\alpha} \subseteq \overline{\bigcup A_\alpha}$. $\blacksquare$

4) Show that X is Hausdorff iff the diagonal $\Delta = \{x \times x : x \in X\}$ is closed in $X \times X$.

($\implies$) Suppose X is Hausdoff. Let $(x, y) \in (X \times X) - \Delta$ (If empty it is trivially open and so $\Delta$ is closed). Then $x \ne y$. Since X is Hausdoff, there exists disjoint open sets U and V in X such that $x \in U$ and $y \in V$. Then $U \times V$ is open in $X \times X$, and $(x, y) \in U \times V$. But $U \times V \subseteq (X \times X) - \Delta$ because U and V are disjoint. Now we show $(X \times X) - \Delta = \bigcup_{(x, y): x \in U \land y \in V}(U \times V)$. We know $\bigcup_{(x, y): x \in U \land y \in V}(U \times V) \subseteq (X \times X) - \Delta$ by $U \times V \subseteq (X \times X) - \Delta$. If $(x, y) \in (X \times X) - \Delta$, then $x \ne y$ and so $(x, y) \in \bigcup_{(x, y): x \in U \land y \in V}(U \times V)$ giving $(X \times X) - \Delta = \bigcup_{(x, y): x \in U \land y \in V}(U \times V)$. This expresses $(X \times X) - \Delta$ as a union of open sets and so it is open. Therefore, $\Delta$ is closed.
($\Longleftarrow$) Suppose $\Delta$ is closed in $X \times X$. Let $x, y \in X$ with $x \ne y$ (trivially Hausdorff if no such pair exists). Then $(x, y) \in (X \times X) - \Delta$. Since $\Delta$ is closed, $(X \times X) - \Delta$ is open. By definition of the product topology, $(X \times X) - \Delta$ is a union of basis elements. Therefore, $(x, y)$ must belong to some basis element B contained in $(X \times X) - \Delta$. Basis elements in the product topology have the form $U \times V$ where U and V are open in X. So there exist open sets U, V in X with $x \in U$, $y \in V$, and $U \times V \subseteq (X \times X) - \Delta$. We claim $U \cap V = \emptyset$: If $z \in U \cap V$, then $(z, z) \in U \times V$. But $U \times V \subseteq (X \times X) - \Delta$, so $(z, z) \not \in \Delta$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, U and V are disjoint open neighborhoods of x and y, so X is Hausdorff. $\blacksquare$

5) Determine the closures of the following subsets of the ordered square:
$$
A = \{(\frac{1}{n}) \times 0 : n \in \mathbb{Z_+}\}
$$
$$
B = \{(1 - \frac{1}{n}) \times 0.5 : n \in \mathbb{Z}_+\}
$$
$$
C = \{x \times 0 : 0 < x < 1\}
$$
$$
D = \{x \times 0.5 : 0 < x < 1\}
$$
$$
E = \{0.5 \times y : 0 < y < 1\}
$$

The ordered square is $[0,1] \times [0,1]$ with the dictionary order topology. $A = \{(1/n) \times 0 : n \in \mathbb{Z}_+\}$
Claim: $\overline{A} = A \cup \{(0, 0)\} = \{(1/n) \times 0 : n \in \mathbb{Z}_+\} \cup \{(0, 0)\}$.

By Theorem 17.5, $x \in \overline{A}$ iff every basis element containing x intersects A. Clearly, $A \subseteq \overline A$. For $(0 \times 0)$, any basis element containing it has the form $[0 \times 0, (a, b)]$ for some $(a, b) > (0, 0)$. If $a > 0$, choose n large enough so that $\frac{1}{n} < a$, then $(\frac{1}{n} \times 0) \in A$ and $\frac{1}{n} \times 0 < (a, b)$. So every basis element containing (0, 0) intersects A. For any other point $(x, y) \ne (0, 0)$ with $(x, y) \not \in A$. If $x = 0$ and $y > 0$, the interval ((0, 0), (0, y)) contains no points of A since all points of A have second coordinate 0. If $x > 0$ and $x \ne 1 / n$ for any n, the interval ((1/x-1, 0), (1/x+1, 0)) contains (x, y) but no points of A. If $x = 1/n$ for some n but $y > 0$, the interval ((1/n, 0), (1/n, 1)) contains (x, y) but no points of A.

$B = \{(1 - 1/n) \times 0.5 : n \in \mathbb{Z}_+\}$ This sequence approaches $(1, 0.5)$. By similar reasoning, every basis element containing $(1, 0.5)$ must intersect B. $\overline{B} = B \cup \{(1, 0.5)\}$

$C = \{x \times 0 : 0 < x < 1\}$ 
Claim: $\overline{C} = C$.
We need to determine which points are limit points of $C$. Case 1: Is $(0, 0) \in \overline{C}$. No. The singleton $\{(0, 0)\}$ is itself a basis element in the dictionary order topology. Since this basis element contains only the point $(0, 0)$ and no points of $C$ (as $C$ consists of points with $x > 0$), we have $(0, 0) \notin \overline{C}$. Case 2: Is $(1, 0) \in \overline{C}$. No. The singleton $\{(1, 0)\}$ is also a basis element in the dictionary order topology. Since this basis element contains only the point $(1, 0)$ and no points of $C$ (as $C$ consists of points with $x < 1$), we have $(1, 0) \notin \overline{C}$. In the dictionary order topology on $[0,1] \times [0,1]$, every point of the form $(a, 0)$ where $a \in [0,1]$ forms a singleton basis element $\{(a, 0)\}$. This is because there is no point "immediately before" $(a, 0)$ in the dictionary order (the point $(a, -\epsilon)$ doesn't exist in our space). Case 3: Is any point $(x, y)$ with $y > 0$ in $\overline{C}$. No. For any such point, the basis element $((x, 0), (x, y))$ contains $(x, y)$ but does not intersect $C$ (since all points in $C$ have second coordinate $0$). Case 4: Are points in $C$ limit points of $C$. Yes, but they're already in $C$. For any $(x, 0)$ with $0 < x < 1$, every basis element containing it intersects $C$.

$D = \{x \times 0.5 : 0 < x < 1\}$ 
Claim: $\overline{D} = D \cup \{1 \times 0.5\}$.
We need to determine which points are limit points of $D$. Case 1: Is $(0, 0.5) \in \overline{D}$. No. The singleton $\{(0, 0.5)\}$ is a basis element (since there's no point immediately before $(0, 0.5)$ - any point $(0, y')$ with $y' < 0.5$ has infinitely many points between it and $(0, 0.5)$). Since $\{(0, 0.5)\}$ doesn't intersect $D$ (all points in $D$ have $x > 0$), we have $(0, 0.5) \notin \overline{D}$. Case 2: Is $(1, 0.5) \in \overline{D}$. No. The singleton $\{(1, 0.5)\}$ is a basis element. Since this contains only $(1, 0.5)$ and no points of $D$ (as $D$ consists of points with $x < 1$), we have $(1, 0.5) \notin \overline{D}$. Case 3: Are other points outside $D$ in $\overline{D}$. No. For any point $(x, y)$ with $y \neq 0.5$, we can find a basis element containing $(x, y)$ that avoids all points with second coordinate $0.5$.

$E = \{0.5 \times y : 0 < y < 1\}$ $\overline{E} = E \cup \{0.5 \times 0\}$ by similar reasoning to C and D.

6) If $A \subseteq X$, we define the boundary of A by the equation $\text{Bd} A = \overline A \cap \overline{X - A}$.
a) Show that Int A and Bd A are disjoint, and $\overline A = \text{Int} A \cup \text{Bd} A$.
b) Show that $\text{Bd} A = \emptyset \iff A$ is both open and closed.
c) Show that U is open iff Bd U $= \overline U - U$.
d) If U is open, it is true that $U = \text{Int} \overline U$?

a)
By definition Bd A = $\overline A \cap \overline{X - A}$. Let x be arbitrary and suppose $x \in \text{Int} A$. Then there exists an open set U with $x \in U \subseteq A$. Then $U \subseteq A$ implies $U \cap (X - A) = \emptyset$, so U does not intersect $X - A$. By theorem 17.5, $x \not \in \overline{X - A}$. Therefore, $x \not \in \text{Bd} A$. So Int A and Bd A are disjoint because x was arbitrary.
Clearly, $\text{Bd} A \subseteq \overline A$ and $\text{Int} A \subseteq \overline A$, so $\text{Int} A \cup \text{Bd} A \subseteq \overline A$. Let a be arbitrary and suppose $x \in \overline A$. Either $x \in \text{Int} A$ or $x \not \in \text{Int} A$. Case 1: $x \in \text{Int} A$. Trivially, x in $\text{Int} A \cup \text{Bd} A$. Case 2: $x \not \in \text{Int} A$. Then every neighborhood of x contains points not in A, so every neighborhood of x intersects $X - A$. By Theorem 17.5, $x \in \overline{X - A}$. Since also $x \in \overline A$, we have $x \in \text{Bd}A$. Therefore, $\overline A = \text{Int} A \cup \text{Bd} A$. $\blacksquare$

b)
($\implies$) Suppose $\text{Bd} A = \emptyset$. Then part a suggests $\overline A = \text{Int} A$. This means $A = \text{Int} A$ since $\text{Int} A \subseteq A \subseteq \overline A = \text{Int} A$. It follows that A is open. $\text{Bd} A = \emptyset$ suggests $\overline A$ and $\overline{X - A}$ are disjoint. Notice, $\overline A \cup \overline{X - A} = X$, and so $\overline{X - A} = X - \overline A$. But $\overline A = A$, so $X - A = \overline{X - A}$ is closed, meaning A is closed.
($\Longleftarrow$) Suppose A is both open and closed. Then $A = \text{Int} A$ and $A = \overline A$ and $X - A$ is also both open and closed. So, $X - A = \overline{X - A}$ by similar reasoning on A. Since A and $X - A$ are disjoint, $\overline A \cap \overline{X - A} = \emptyset$. $\blacksquare$

c)
Suppose U is open. Then Int U = U. Part a states then that $\overline U = U \cup \text{Bd} U$, so $\text{Bd} U = \overline U - U$.
Suppose $\text{Bd} U = \overline U - U$. Then $\overline U = U \cup \text{Bd} U = U \cup (\overline U - U) = \overline U$ from part a. Also from part a, $\overline U = \text{Int} U \cup \text{Bd} U$. So $U = \text{Int} U \cup (\text{Bd} U \cap U)$. Since $\text{Bd} U = \overline{U} - U$, we have $\text{Bd} U \cap U = \emptyset$. Therefore, $U = \text{Int} U$, so U is open. $\blacksquare$

d)
No. Let $X = \mathbb{R}$ with standard topology and $U = (0, 1) \cup (1, 2)$. Then $\overline U = [0, 2]$, and $\text{Int} \overline U = (0, 2)$. Since $1 \in \text{Int} \overline U$ but $1 \not \in U$, we have $U \ne \text{Int} \overline U$. $\blacksquare$
